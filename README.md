Requires semantic-version library
  -"pip install semantic_version"
  -"https://pypi.org/project/semantic-version/"

For the simples way to learn how to use CiteSoft, open runExample.py then run it.  Then open the two CiteSoft txt files generated, and also MathExample.py.

Basically, when runExample.py is run, citations are generated in a "CheckPoint" file for the module and the functions inside MathExample.py
Finally, the citations are consolidated with duplicate entries removed.
